HSA - HTL Shkoder App
===

It’s been the 4th year in this school and throughout these years we have had a lot of
difficulties with the exchange of information with the teachers. That’s why we thought
of developing this application.
The most common difficulties are the following:
• Timetable changes – At the beginning of the school year there is a temporary
timetable, which changes again and again. Students don’t always see these
changes on time.
• Teacher replacement table – There were many situations, when teachers
were absent but we weren’t informed.
• Vacation schedule – During the school year we have some days off and we
should be informed about these on time.
• Mark average – Every students likes to know what his actual mark average is.
• Subject matters and homework – When we miss the lesson, we miss what
was taught during class as well as the homework.
What we mentioned above are the main goals of our application, plus some
additional ones.
